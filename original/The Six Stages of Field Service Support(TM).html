<p>
If you have always wondered about the various stages of support action
your computer maker provides when your system self-destructs, here is
a handy guide that will tell you everything you ever wanted to know
about the Six Stages of Field Service Support and how to identify the
symptoms of being at each stage.


<p>
Much of this knowledge is based on twenty-five years of careful observations
at sites with DECsystem-20s, DEC Alphas, IBM 370/155, VAX 11/780, IBM 4341,
and other systems with many different service organizations.&nbsp; Some machines
needed more help than others.&nbsp;  For example, the DEC-20 once managed to get
over 300 hours of down-time in a single month, so it needed lots of
support.&nbsp; And that wasn't one of the months when the computer room filled
with sewage.



<h3>
DISCLAIMER #1
</h3>
I have dealt with other computer companies and the following stages
apply to just about every vendor out there, so don't think that I am just
picking on Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), now a proud division of
the Compaq Computer Assimilation Corporation, er wait, make that the
Hewlett Packard Assimilation Corporation.&nbsp;
These rules of the service and support universe also apply to almost every
mechanical or electronic thing, including that toner-belching photo-copier
you love to hate.


<h3>
DISCLAIMER #2
</h3>
<p>
For those of you that think I didn't like the DEC-20, don't get me wrong.&nbsp;
It was one of the best computer architectures I have ever dealt with, and
TWENEX and TOPS-20 were two of the best operating systems around at the
time, certainly better than OS/MVT, VM, HASP, MS-DOS and the other junk
that the competition were pushing.&nbsp;  And the TOPS-20 clock won't go boom
in a few years like most other systems I know.&nbsp;  DEC learned their lesson
in 1978 when all the PDP-11s fell over.


<p> 
Regardless of who made your computer or how large or small it is, these
events may seem hauntingly familiar.



<h3>
THE "YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED" DISCLAIMER
</h3>

In case you needed to be told, there are barrels of :-) here.



<p>

    "May the road rise to meet you, and may you never go beyond Stage Two."

<h2>
Stage Zero
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	The Return of the BUGHLT: SWPUPT
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	or &nbsp; How I hate the message "%DECSYSTEM-20 NOT RUNNING"
</h2>

<p>

Stage Zero is where your journey begins when all is well and then suddenly
all the terminals around the university or office go dead and the
French-fryer" beepers on the DECwriter terminals all simultaneously go
off.&nbsp; This is the way that the TOPS-20 operating system told everybody
that it had crashed and that it had also lost what everybody was doing.&nbsp;
Alerted by the beeping sounds or the cries of anguish from the users (or both),
the keepers of the system rush to the machine room.&nbsp;  On arriving in the
machine room, you may smell the problem or just see the flames coming out
of the processor.


<p>

This type of event invariably happens four minutes after the daily
service contract period ends, which means it will cost big bucks to get
the Field Service Engineers (FSEs) to come out to fix the problem right
now.&nbsp;  Your management has also disappeared for the day, leaving you with
no authority to spend money to get help.<small><a href="#F1"><b>[1]</b></a></small>


<p>

Meanwhile, the users are already starting to press their noses and cheeks
against the computer room windows, as if they think that their concerned
stares will somehow make things better.&nbsp;   Believe me, it does not.&nbsp;
To avoid gazing in that direction, everybody in the computer room will avoid
looking towards the windows, even to the extreme of walking backwards and
feeling behind themselves for the manuals in the bookcase that was placed too
close to the visitor viewing windows.&nbsp;  More often than not, this results
in more accidents, such as knocking over the one gallon jar of jalapeno
peppers that formed the complete daily evening meal for the console operator.
Seriously.


<p>

Left with all the options that don't involve spending new money, you go and
call DDC, the Digital Diagnostic Center (saying this is always accompanied
by a jarring chord of music, such as that heard in the film "Monty Python and
the Holy Grail" when they say "A SHRUBBERY!"). 


<p>

For those of you who don't deal with DEC, DDC is this neat service that
you call when your computer system starts doing strange things.&nbsp;  DDC 
can run diagnostics on your computer from where they live (used to be Colorado
Springs, but its latest incarnation seems to be in a facility in Atlanta
which seems to be named after a space alien who used to appear in
badly-written sitcoms - ALF) or study core dumps your machine may have
emitted, and these tests help isolate the problem before the local service
office even knows that there is a problem.&nbsp;  Well, that was the idea
anyway.  


<p>

If the support structure for your computer doesn't have something
equivalent to DDC, proceed to Stage One.


<p>

Assuming you do have a DDC-a-like, you give them a call, and they will take
your name, phone number and serial number.&nbsp;  (The serial number of the
computer, not yours.)&nbsp;   They may even ask what the trouble
is.<small><a href="#F2"><b>[2]</b></a></small>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now they will tell you that they will call you back as soon as they have a
service representative available.&nbsp;  Actually, this delay is deliberate and
gives DDC time to check their records to make sure that the serial number you
gave them really resides at the phone number you gave them when you
called.&nbsp; They learned this precaution from the pizza delivery industry,
either that or else DEC had a lot of problems with the wild guys over at the
Delta-I-Q fraternity house at MIT calling in prank trouble tickets on the
campus computers (or perhaps on computers belonging to other schools).&nbsp;
I hear that "wild" stuff like that still happens all the time up there.


<p>

Just substitute the name of your remote support service company where it says
"DDC".


<p>

Anyway, sometime later, someone from DDC will call you over some
trans-Atlantic phone
line.<small><a href="#F3"><b>[3]</b></a></small>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Going to a quiet room to talk to the service
representative won't help as they always have you go back into the machine
room and load the field-service pack and set switches on the front-end
processor and "boot from SW" or perhaps they have you just stand in front of
the computer and see if the floppy drive light comes on.&nbsp;  For machines
with more than one switch, the DDC reps always seem to insult your
intelligence by giving the switch settings like: "Set the two right-most
switches down and then skip two switches and push the next one
down."&nbsp;  People who have called DDC more than once learn to ignore these
instructions since DDC always asks for the same switch settings and so you
just set the proper octal value on the front-end processor control panel and
say "uh huh" a lot to the rep.


<p>

DDC can now take over your system via the front-end processor and run
diagnostics which test the various parts of the machine as well as testing 
the amount of paper you have left in the console DECwriter terminal.


<p>

You must not leave the area while these tests are being run, because the
DDC person will probably contact you next, not by calling you on the phone,
but by typing messages to you on the console.&nbsp;  If you aren't sitting right
there so you can respond, the DDC rep may go away and you get to start
the problem reporting process all over.&nbsp;  You need to hang around anyway
because someone needs to be standing by to un-jam the console printer.


<p>

If the tests eventually find something wrong, DDC will contact the local
field service office who will come out to your location with "all the parts
necessary"<small><a href="#F4"><b>[4]</b></a></small>&nbsp;
to work on the diagnosed problem whenever the on-site service
period resumes.&nbsp;  By having a FSE arrive at your site, you proceed to
Stage One.


<p>

If DDC is unable to run any diagnostics because the front-end processor
is dead or the smoke that is pouring out of the system is too thick for you
to see if the floppy drive light is coming on, proceed to Stage One.


<p>

If DDC doesn't find anything wrong, count the number of times that the
system has crashed in the last week from unexplained causes or problems
that cannot be diagnosed that you have reported to DDC.&nbsp;  If the number
of crashes is greater than a secret quantity which you do not know and will
not be told, proceed to Stage
One.<small><a href="#F5"><b>[5]</b></a></small>&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you haven't reached the magic number, reboot the system and
remain in Stage Zero, although after each crash, DDC might give you a slight
change to make to the system configuration that will help cloud the issue
later when the troops do arrive.

A no-win situation.&nbsp;  You will be blamed for not taking any action
as the down-time will cost the business money because the systems
were down, and you will be blamed for spending unauthorized money
if you do take action.  The best solution is to take the back door
and get out now.

Don't try to force details of the crash on the first person you
reach.&nbsp;  They are usually trained only to get a few contact details
and if you try to give them information on the actual problem,
they are just as likely to overwrite your phone number with the
problem description, delaying the return call further.


<p>

Actually the remote support people do not always use a trans-Atlantic
phone line.&nbsp;  With the discount phone services now available, your
phone call can also be routed over those phone lines you see in the
country laying in the ditch and bushes along the railroad tracks.&nbsp;
All of these phone lines have the requisite Signal-to-Noise Ratio
of about 0.2dB.&nbsp;  This low quality phone line actually has a valid
purpose.&nbsp;  Since it is so difficult to communicate with the support
representative, you are less likely to start any lengthy
conversations about how much smoke is coming out of the
malfunctioning system, how many students are standing behind you
with final exams next week, or how much money your firm will lose
if the machine isn't fixed.&nbsp;   Subsequently, this allows the rep
to spend more time looking at the diagnostic results and frees up
reps so that they can help other sites quicker.


<p>

<dt>[4]
<dd>

"All the parts necessary" really means, "all the spares kits that
should contain the right parts necessary".&nbsp;  These black cases
can truly be a Pandora's box, because sometimes the boards within
have come out of another machine across town and may possess their
own special problems that can now be added to yours.

<p>

An added complexity is that these days for certain systems, they seem
to bring one and only one card out at a time, meaning you have to wait
if any associated cable, screw or other part is discovered to be
the real culprit.


<p>
<a name="F5">
</a>
<dt>[5]
<dd>

Although not revealed, you will be told by phone if you have reached
the requisite number of crashes or not.&nbsp;  Phrases like "this is a
real strange one" mean you are getting close but not quite there.&nbsp;
On the other hand, "I'll pass this call on to the local office"
means that you are closer to zero than you are to the magic
number.&nbsp; "I'll get right back to you" means that the local office
is going to call you next, not the person at DDC.&nbsp;  I never
understood that one.


<p>

If the FSE was on site when the problem initially occurred, or if
you have fallen back to Stage Zero from a higher level, the phrase
"I'm going to get some other kits out of the car" or "we [Royal We]
are going out for some lunch" indicates that you have not had
sufficient reproducible failures to warrant a gutting of the
system.&nbsp;  The hope is that the machine will either repair itself
before they get back, or it will completely melt-down, allowing them
to skip to Support Stage Two, where your service call escalates
and the problem becomes Someone Else's Problem (SEP).

<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or  &nbsp; "Why you should invest in some ACME handcuffs and chains"
</h2>

<p>

You arrive at Stage One in one of five ways:


<p>
<dl compact>
<dt>1.
<dd>

DDC was called and the diagnostics found something wrong with your system.


<p>
<dt>2.
<dd>

DDC was called many times and the diagnostics have not found any
cause for the crashes.&nbsp;  You must reach the magic (and secret)
number of crashes and phone calls to support to use this reason.&nbsp;
Accompanied by this reason is a mandatory replacement of a piece
of hardware.&nbsp;  When pressed, the vendor may actually admit that
none of the diagnostics actually identified this as being the failing
part, but they felt they had to bring at least one part to your
site.


<p>
<dt>3.
<dd>

DDC has recommended some combination of the application of OS
upgrades, patch kits, backing-out patch kits, reformatting and
reinstalling the OS without the patch kits, putting anti-nuclear-blast
sticky-tape on the windows, downgrades to earlier OSes, small animal
sacrifices, and none of these things have made you go away.&nbsp;  You,
not the problem.<small><a href="#F6"><b>[6]</b></a></small>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Having exhausted the standard list of software-related
causes, the ball gets lobbed-into the hardware group even if the
problem started the instant you applied a new OS upgrade.&nbsp;  Now,
field service is sent to make sense of what so far has been done
remotely, or if the failure seems to make sense, change some hardware
around in your system so that the failure really won't make any sense.

	
<p>
<dt>4.
<dd>

You don't have anything equivalent to DDC for your system.


<p>
<dt>5.
<dd>

Field Service was performing the monthly Preventive Maintenance
(PM) and the system wouldn't boot any more when they got finished.&nbsp;
(This is the equivalent of your car not starting any more after 
having the guy at the gas station "check under the
hood".)<small><a href="#F7"><b>[7]</b></a></small>


<p>

You are not in Stage One if the FSE was performing PM on your system
and when you returned from lunch, you found your entire VAX 11/780
tilting at a 45-degree angle, with the FSE desperately trying to
get the system back upright or at least trying to keep it from
tilting any further.&nbsp;  This actually happened once in my presence -
something about not extending those stabilizer legs before opening
all of the cabinets.&nbsp;  Now, if the system does tip completely over,
<i>then</i> you get to go to Stage One, right after the FSE goes to the
hospital.

</dl>

<p>

If the Field Service Engineer wasn't already on the scene in Stage Zero,
most FSEs must go through a period of disbelief about the severity or
existence of the problem that you are reporting before serious work on
the problem begins.&nbsp;  This hesitant behavior is usually characterized by
the FSE walking into the machine room, observing the flames coming out of
the system cabinets and saying: "AH, HA!  This looks like a software problem."  


<p>

Even if the FSE was on-site and the machine worked perfectly before they
started doing routine maintenance on it, the FSE still may accuse you of
running an operating system that has been "patched" or "customized".&nbsp;
Anything beyond setting the local time-zone may be considered to be
"customized", even if you replaced broken application executables with ones
from earlier vendor-provided versions that do work.&nbsp;  You are generally
doomed if you are running NIDEC ("Not Invented by DEC") software.&nbsp;  In
the 1980s, you would expect questions such as, "Are you trying to run UNIX or
something?"&nbsp; In the late 1990s, it is "Are you trying to run FreeBSD/NetBSD
or something?"


<p>

If you are talking about problems with a photocopier, the question would be
something like "You aren't trying to make double-sided copies, are you?"


<p>

Although the FSE is now at your site, he/she may leave at any moment, causing
you to return to Stage
Zero.<small><a href="#F8"><b>[8]</b></a></small>&nbsp;&nbsp;
You will advance firmly into Stage One
if any of the following occur:


<p>
<dl compact>
<dt>1.
<dd>

Something obviously wrong was detected using the diagnostics.&nbsp;
(Being unable to even start the diagnostics will always get
you to stick in Stage One.)


<p>
<dt>2.
<dd>

The system has crashed a number of times greater than the
secret quantity that forces a Stage One.&nbsp;  Because this
number is so secret, the FSEs aren't always up to date with what the
secret value is today and so the FSE may not think things are
as bad as DDC decided they are.


<p>
<dt>3.
<dd>

The Fire Department has just allowed you to re-enter the building
after extinguishing the "software problem" by hosing down the memory
cabinet (M-Box), even though the fire was in the processor cabinet
(E-Box).


</dl>

<p>

Stage One typically directs the FSE to change any boards that the
diagnostics indicate are causing the problem.&nbsp;  If the diagnostics won't
even run, this step is either skipped or the FSE swaps whatever boards he
happens to have in the processor (aka "KL") spare
case.<small><a href="#F9"><b>[9]</b></a></small>


<p>

If the diagnostics then run without incident and the operating system will
get as far as asking if it is okay to run CHECKD (an incredibly slow
fsck<small><a href="#F10"><b>[10]</b></a></small>)
the FSE may consider
the problem solved and may leave.&nbsp;  Depending on the number of times they
have been called to look at the same problem in recent days, the FSE may
hang around until the system gets as far as asking for the current date
or starts the network interfaces before leaving.&nbsp;  The goal here is
apparently to be out of the area prior to the "login" prompt appearing, or
more likely, not appearing.


<p>

If the diagnostics now find a problem, the indicated board is replaced
with one from "the spares kit".&nbsp;  Hopefully the FSE brought the right
spares kit with him.&nbsp;  If not, you will experience a delay in getting a
replacement component, which he may have to get, or it will be delivered by the
tag-team FSE.&nbsp;   (Some creative FSEs will, in this case, replace some
other unrelated cards that they do have, just in case the diagnostic is
mistaken.&nbsp;  This kills time - and possibly your machine - nicely.)


<p>

After inserting the replacement part, make sure that the FSE re-runs
the diagnostics before he leaves to make sure that:

<blockquote>
<dl compact>
<dt>A.
<dd>

The replacement card cured the problem or made the problem move
elsewhere (symptom changes).

<p>
<dt>B.
<dd>

The replacement card isn't worse than the one that was in
the machine in the first place.

</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>

A spooky thing that happens here is that most FS organizations seem to have a
policy that a board will be tagged as "bad" only if it has a solid failure
which "follows" the board.&nbsp;  If a board can be moved to a different machine
or different slot in the machine and the problem goes away, or the problem
is intermittent, the board will be replaced, but may not be tagged as being
defective.&nbsp;   This board now ends up in the spares kit.&nbsp;  Remember
this board; it may come back, or worse, you might get someone else's headache-board.  


<p>

Once the problem appears to go away, you fall back to Stage Zero, but
the failure counter is incremented.


<p>

If, when you arrived at Stage One, the FSE ran diagnostics and they ran
successfully and do not complain about anything, the FSE usually pulls and
re-seats all the cards in the system.&nbsp;  Some FSE's then haul out
the pencil eraser and clean the connectors when practical, which seems to
always be extremely fatal to the cards that get erased.&nbsp;  This type of
activity seems to always help advance you to Stage Two.


<p>

The problem for you at this point in Stage One is figuring out what is going
on.&nbsp;  The FSE's usually won't tell you what they are up to, so you have to
watch for tell-tale signs.


<p>

You are quickly advancing toward Stage Two if:


<p>
<dl compact>
<dt>1.
<dd>

The system diagnostics display a warning like:

<pre>

	WARNING:  ONLY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS 1 THROUGH 64 CAN BE RUN
		  WITH MAIN MEMORY DISCONNECTED!

</pre>

	This is always a dead giveaway, particularly if you only called
	the FSE in to fix a tape drive.


<p>
<dt>2.
<dd>

The diagnostics display messages on the console like:

<pre>

	TEST #1, KL LOOP TEST
	#KL LOOP FAILURz
	@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@...

</pre>

and the '@' characters continue to print for several pages of
paper until someone stops it.


<p>
<dt>3.
<dd>

There are absolutely no signs of life in the system at all, and
even after some parts are swapped, or possibly *because* of the
part swapping, none of the diagnostics will even start.

<p>
<dt>4.
<dd>

The FSE's ask if you have any extra copies of the front-end
diagnostic or configuration diskettes.&nbsp;  Do not anger the
FSE by asking "Why?&nbsp;  What's wrong with the site copy?"


<p>
<dt>5.
<dd>

The FSE asks if you happen to remember the password on the
field-service pack, or if you happened to have duplicated
that pack recently.<small><a href="#F11"><b>[11]</b></a></small>


<p>
<dt>6.
<dd>

The FSE's ask you where the on-site microfiche is that they left
at your site the last time there was significant trouble.&nbsp;  The
only worse sign is when they actually go though the fiche and merge
in the Update and Correction 'fiche and discard the old sheets.&nbsp;
This activity is usually given priority close to that of sorting
your sock drawer.&nbsp;  You may safely assume that you have serious
problems if you see this activity.&nbsp;  For more modern support
organizations, they may ask if there is a web browser on a machine
that <strong><i>is</i></strong> working that they can use, but the FSE
may also have to make some calls first to find out what the support
URLs are this week.

<p>
<dt>7.
<dd>

The FSE's ask if you have a 'scope, or worse, a soldering iron.&nbsp;
FSE's normally only do board swapping, and only a few of them
can use a soldering iron without inflicting serious injury
on themselves or your computer.

This is an important and little-understood part of FS organizations.&nbsp;
A considerable percentage of open tickets are resolved simply by
wearing out the customer, who simply gives up, or is forced to turn
attention to other issues at some point, allowing the FS organization to
close the ticket with some log entry like "Issue resolved, no further
complaints, feedback or signs of breathing from customer."&nbsp;  To
speed this date, expect a
regular pattern of requests for more information, such as the massive
SYSCHECK that DEC has you run every few days on the off-chance that your
system configuration has changed, apart from you having to add disk
storage to hold all the SYSCHECK output logs.&nbsp;  Any lack of
promptness in returning this material may be considered to be a sign that
the issue no longer exists and that you are happy, when in fact you are
actually occupied down in the local bankruptcy court.

Although Preventative Maintenance used to mainly involve cleaning the
air filters, and perhaps running some memory diagnostics, sometimes
they also used to apply mandatory field changes to your hardware.&nbsp;
That sounds great until you find that the hardware change now renders
the OS you have incapable of booting, until you upgrade the OS as
well.&nbsp; Scheduling backups just before PM isn't such a bad idea.


<a name="F8">

An interesting piece of trivia should be mentioned at this point:
You have no doubt seen these data processing facilities with extra-heavy
security measures like guard stations that make you sign in and out,
card entry, double-door man-traps, cameras everywhere, etc.&nbsp;  You no
doubt have always assumed that all of this stuff was to keep terrorists,
Rush Limbaugh, Barney the Purple object and other unauthorized things
from getting into your computer room, and this reason is often given
to company auditors and accountants to justify the outrageous cost for
all of the cameras,
guards and guns. 
<p>
Experienced Data Processing and Information Systems facility personnel
know that the real reason for all of this security is to keep the FSE's
from managing to leave the site before the systems can be completely
restarted, at which point you might notice that only 512K of your
multi-Megabytes of main memory are still visible, and only one CPU is
still responding.
<p>
The longer it takes to bring the computer systems up to the point
where work can be done on them, the more security measures the facility
that houses the computers will have.&nbsp;  Think about it.


<a name="F9">

For you non-DECies, the KL is last of the "big" 36 bit ECL processors in
the PDP-10 line to make it out of the lab.&nbsp;  (There was one called
"Jupiter" but it had an accident.&nbsp;  The KS-10 did come out a bit later,
but it was a lower-performance unit.)


<a name="F10">
</a>
<p>
<dt>[10]
<dd>

For you non-DECies, CHECKD is this file-system checker that takes
a huge amount of time, even if nothing is wrong.&nbsp;  CHECKD used to
check about 8 megabytes of disk data a minute, so a dual-RP06 public
structure (which contains about 400meg total) took about 45 minutes
to check, if it didn't have a lot of data stored on it.&nbsp;  So it
could easily take 50 minutes or more before people could use the
computer to find out if the system was working normally again.&nbsp;  
TOPS-20 would ask if you wanted to run CHECKD with a message like 

<pre>

     Run CHECKD? No
     %XYZZY Warning - Replying 'No' is equivalent to slitting
	    your wrists with a tape leader trimming tool.
     Run CHECKD? Yes

</pre>

So everybody always ran CHECKD.

The field-service disk pack is a removable hard disk (or a compact disc) 
that usually belongs to the computer maker and is kept at sites that
have enough problems or a higher level of service agreement.&nbsp;  It
usually contains all diagnostics for the machine in question, a burn-in
or
endurance test directory, and copies of LISP-HAUNT, MDL-ZORK, 10TREK,
ADVENTURE, PERL, DOOM and EMACS (all for system stressing/loading
purposes, of course.)&nbsp;  This pack or disc is the proprietary property
of the field service organization and the site management are usually
forbidden from even gazing at this object any longer than necessary.

Stage Two
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; District Service goes on alert
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  or &nbsp; "Call for back-up, Dano"
<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; or &nbsp; Curly: "Hey Moe! &nbsp;  This pipe is full of wires!"

 Moe: &nbsp;"That's a fine place for putting wires.  Well, rip 'em out!"<small><a href="#F12"><b>[12]</b></a></small>
</h2>


<p>

Stage Two occurs when the first FSE has been unable to fix the problem
after a given amount of time, usually about 6 hours, or (more likely) the
problem has grown considerably in scope.


<p>

Here additional forces arrive from the local office.&nbsp;  Sometimes it is
simply one other FSE bringing more spare boards, or he is sent to relieve
the first FSE.&nbsp;  More often than not, this arrival allows one of the FSEs
to keep you and your staff distracted while the other FSE tries to retrieve
his wrist-watch from the system
backplane<small><a href="#F13"><b>[13]</b></a></small>&nbsp;
without being spotted by you.


<p>

The second FSE reviews the situation as briefed by the first FSE, looking
for anything obvious that would correct the problem, such as turning *all*
of the power circuit breakers back on, putting the right cards in the right
slots, using Beta instead of VHS, adding toner, etc.&nbsp;  This process
frequently catches really stupid errors but you will always be given an
extremely complex (and bogus) explanation of what the problem was that has
now been fixed.&nbsp;
Note that there is no guarantee that the second FSE is more senior or
knowledgeable than the first, but sometimes that doesn't
matter.<small><a href="#F14"><b>[14]</b></a></small>


<p>

If both FSEs are unable to make headway, the local office may also
send the FSE who has the most experience with this particular system or
this type of problem, assuming he isn't at your site already.&nbsp;  You can
usually tell when this FSE appears, as he has a complete set of spare
parts in his car, and possibly his own microfiche viewer or laptop
computer.&nbsp; (Unlike all others, this FSE will replace burnt-out indicator
light bulbs without you having to open a ticket.)


<p>

This "senior" FSE will usually get the other FSEs on site to go do something
else (like buy food) and while they are gone, he will then try to assess the
situation, both by looking at the diagnostics, and by talking to you.&nbsp; 
This allows him to determine how many of the current problems were there when
work began.&nbsp;    (Note that in some organizations, the arrival of the
Senior FSE is the start of Stage Three.)


<p>

Depending on the maintenance agreement you have with the service organization,
in Stage Two the FSEs may hang around until whatever time your shop normally
closes for the night, or stay on until you pass out, at which point they will
sneak-out anyway and may even come back in the morning.


<p>

Most problems are resolved in the latter phases of Stage Two, so there isn't
a lot of other interesting things to say here.&nbsp;  Getting to Stage Three
is mainly a function of time, although a really spectacular event, such as
any of these headlines in the campus newspaper will get you to Stage Three
faster:

</p>
<blockquote>
<big>
<strong><big><i>"FSE taken over by stranger-than-usual aliens!&nbsp; Biology
department impressed!"</i></big></strong>,
<br>
<br>
<strong><big><i>"Walls bleed in campus
computer center - OS Upgrade identified as cause"</i></big></strong>,
or

<strong><big><i> "Trouble ticket open for 28 months causes vendors bug tracking
system to form black hole!&nbsp; Reports say damage worse than what was predicted for
Y2K problem!"</i></big></strong><small><a href="#F15"><b>[15]</b></a></small>
</big>
</blockquote>

<p>
If the system starts working while at Stage Two, you return to Stage Zero,
although the secret failure counter doesn't return to zero.&nbsp;  It does
goes down a little for every day that the system keeps working, and reaches
zero after about a week.


<p>
If after two more days you still have FSEs (possibly four of them now lurk
around the room by now), you go to Stage
Three.<small><a href="#F16"><b>[16]</b></a></small>

The Three Stooges remain one of the best-documented set of Field
Service Engineers ever recorded in action.&nbsp;  Their films show how
to handle repairs on electrical wiring, plumbing, vehicles and
dozens of other service activities.&nbsp;  These training shorts may
still be shown in "Introduction to Field Service 101" courses.

Actually it was a metal chain, not a wristwatch.&nbsp;  If you recall
the TV series "Batman", they had signs hanging over all of the
things in the "Bat Cave", so that people who were not familiar
with the objects would know what they were.&nbsp;  So there were 
signs that said things like <strong>"BAT COMPUTER"</strong>,
<strong>"BAT GENERATOR"</strong>, <strong>"BAT GUANO"</strong>,
etc.&nbsp;  These signs were clearly unnecessary to Batman
and company who supposedly knew what all that stuff was.&nbsp;  Here is
the secret:  The signs were really there for the "Bat Tours".


<p>

Well, like most universities, someone in the hierarchy decided
that we just had to have signs explaining what the various cabinets
in the computer room were (<strong>"AIR CONDITIONER", "DISK DRIVE",
"BOX THAT BUZZES LOUDLY AND DOESN'T LIKE WATER"</strong>, etc), so
that when a tour
occurred, the signs would be there and the visitors could try to
read the signs as they flapped wildly around in the forced-air of
the computer room.&nbsp;  They also helped the director of the facility
correctly identify the object he was pointing at while giving tours,
since he doesn't go in the computer room very often.&nbsp;  So on a
typical tour, you might hear an exchange like this:

<blockquote>

Director: "And this is the IBM 370/155, which cost the school over
two million dollars, money that could have been spent on the football
program.&nbsp;  Yes, a question in back?"

<p>

Guest: "Yes, are you sure that is the '370?&nbsp;  It really looks more
like a swivel chair with a green colored stain."

<p>

Second Guest: "Perhaps the '370 is the large blue box
with all the flashing lights behind the chair?"

<p>

Director: "No, these signs are very accurate and thousands of dollars
were spent to make and install them, money that could have been spent
on the new stadium."

</blockquote>

<p>

In our case, some signs would flap around so wildly that they would
come loose from the ceiling and fall to the floor.&nbsp;  Eventually,
someone would pick these lost signs up and simply lay them 
on top of the appropriate box.&nbsp;  Months later, probably just
minutes before the next start-of-semester tours, some knowledgeable
soul would get a ladder and reinstall the signs in the appropriate
locations, more or less.&nbsp;  In the meantime, the signs quietly
rested on top of the computers, waiting for their chance.


<p>

Which brings us to our FSE, the victim of this story.&nbsp;  Called to
correct a minor problem with eight of the 64 serial ports on a
DECsystem-20, he has the PDP-11 cabinet on the DEC-20 extended out of
the machine to measure some voltages and reaches on top of the
computer for a screwdriver he placed there earlier.&nbsp;  Instead of
picking the screwdriver up, he drags it across the top, dragging the
chain and the <strong>"LARGE ORANGE BOX WITH NO FLASHING LIGHTS WHICH
MAKES A BORING TOUR STOP"</strong> sign along with it, and the chain
and sign fall neatly into the card cage, in full view of our staff.


<p>

The FSE, thinking it would be better to get that metal chain out of
there, particularly since the computer was on, pulls the chain
out and puts it back on top and continues with the measurements.&nbsp;
After a few minutes he returns to the console area, puzzled
that he can't find the signal he was looking for on ANY board.&nbsp;
And for some reason, now the console doesn't work any more.&nbsp;  This
person had clearly lost the gift of cause and effect analysis.


<p>

We nearly went to Stage Three to resolve this one, despite witnesses
repeatedly telling the additional FSEs exactly what happened.&nbsp;
Eventually, our service vendor did get a nice letter from our
management saying that this particular FSE would not be let in the
building ever again.

Occasionally, it is the novice-"Wesley Crusher"-type who shows up
mainly to bring parts and ends up depressing the HALT button that
saves the day, assuming the system can be saved at this point.&nbsp;
When this "I just flipped this switch and everything works great now"
stuff happens, it irritates the senior FSEs who have been on site for
hours, and who probably will secretly dispose of Wesley's body in the

Recent evidence shows that if a trouble ticket stays open for an
embarrassingly-long amount of time (like 14 months), the vendor
might "accidentally" close it, and immediately open a new ticket
for the same problem, resetting the response-time clock, at least
in their minds.&nbsp;   This is similar to airlines that pull away from
the gate on time, and then park the plane on some unused part of the
airport for two hours before actually taking off because of bad
weather somewhere else.&nbsp;  Officially, the plane did leave on time.

Note that if at some point, a crash is determined or strongly
suspected of being a software problem, all support clocks freeze.&nbsp;
About the only way to go to the next level of support is to start
reporting the problem and the misdeeds of the service organization
on the Internet.&nbsp;  At minimum, this gets you a conference call
with a lot of people "committed to your problem" but nothing happens
for months, and at best, the FSE structure advances to Stage Three.

<h2>
Stage Three
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	Your problems go Regional!
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	or &nbsp; &nbsp; Note one of the words in 'Regional Playoffs' is 'off'.
</h2>

<p>

Congratulations, you have reached Stage Three.&nbsp;  You did this by keeping
FSEs at your site over three or more days (two days if they were there
more than 14 hours a day), or whining about the situation in public
forums on the Internet with samples and embarrassing photos.&nbsp;  Your
management can speed or slow the arrival of Stage Three support depending on
how many calls are made to the computer vendor and how threatening he/she/it
can sound: 


<p>
<blockquote>

Educational Non-Threatening: "We have 25,000 students that are unable to
complete their projects and will get failing grades and then
beat on our cars or use the skills they learned in chemistry
classes against us if you don't fix this computer."

<p>

Educational Threatening: "I own a rocket launcher and am coming to your house
NOW if you don't fix this computer."


<p>

Business Non-Threatening: "We have over 50,000 customers who can't download
cooking recipes off the Internet because of this problem."


<p>

Business Threatening: "We are going to tell 50,000 of our customers - all of
whom own rocket launchers - where you are if you don't fix
this computer, as you are preventing them from downloading
'porn off the Internet fast enough."

</blockquote>

<p>

To be at Stage Three, things are really messed up now and parts of your
system that never bothered you before are probably malfunctioning.&nbsp;  You
might even be getting error messages regarding peripherals your system
doesn't even have.


<p>

The failing system is also starting to look more like it did prior to being
originally assembled, as more and more loose parts litter the area.


<p>

The Regional FSEs, usually out of a major city like Chicago, Creede, Houston,
or Twin Peaks<small><a href="#F18"><b>[18]</b></a></small>&nbsp;
arrive to at least stabilize the situation, and hopefully,
get the system back to the level of functionality you had back at Stage
Zero.&nbsp; If they fix it completely, that is a plus, but no longer the main
goal.


<p>

The Stage Three patrol does a lot of rediscovering.&nbsp;  This means that
they ignore most or all of the information obtained in the earlier
stages and must experience it for
themselves<small><a href="#F19"><b>[19]</b></a></small>.&nbsp;
If your system will run,
you have to bring it up and let the users on, knowing that at any
moment it will go down again, erasing the unsaved work of hundreds of
students, co-workers or customers, who know where you are and possibly which
car you drive.


<p>

You are told to not warn the users about what is going on because they
would not use the system in the same way they normally do if they knew
it might crash at any second, and this might cause the problem to not occur.


<p>

Note it is almost impossible to descend from Stage Three back to Stage
Two.&nbsp; Even if it takes a day or more to fail, these guys usually
hang around, along with your growing collection of FSEs from the earlier
stages that have taken-up residence.


<p>

Finally, the system crashes.&nbsp;  Hurrah!&nbsp;  Now the suit jackets come
off and the neckties get caught in the printer drum.&nbsp;  No, wait, that
only happened once.  


<p>

Stage Three personnel bring their own 'scopes and other strange test equipment,
most of which appears to have been obtained from the set of the film
"Frankenstein", which they may have wired into your machine before the
demonstration crash.&nbsp;  If they didn't do this earlier, they will wire it
all up now and ask you to make the system crash again in the same way, as
they really will be watching this time.  


<p>

You may go to Stage Four if the system will not run with the test instruments
attached, but this isn't a sure thing.&nbsp;  You will definitely go to Stage
Four if they disconnect the test equipment and now the system won't do
anything at all.&nbsp; "They've taken Spocks
brain!"<small><a href="#F20"><b>[20]</b></a></small>


<p>

After a crash occurs in front of the instruments, the FSEs will take
action.&nbsp; Usually its a phone call to someone at the corporate
headquarters, where you may overhear them say stuff like "If it was human,
it's dead.&nbsp;  No wait, the 'scope probe came loose."&nbsp;  (Now speaking
to you)  "Uh, can you make it crash
again?"<small><a href="#F21"><b>[21]</b></a></small>


<p>

The people from Stage Three usually have special diagnostics that the
local office never get, or that they didn't know about, or they left them
at another local site, or are at this moment are stuffed in the dollar-changer
in the Coke machine back at their office with a "Thieving @*%!! Machine" note
written on it.&nbsp;   Anyway, these newly-used diagnostics provide a new
wealth of information to examine, but invariably result in more phone calls
to back to Mr.
Peabody<small><a href="#F22"><b>[22]</b></a></small>, who is the only person
in the world who knows what the diagnostics are trying to report.


<p>

The chant of Stage Three becomes "Okay, we have a recorded failure.&nbsp; We can
rebuild the system.&nbsp;  We have the technology.&nbsp;  We have the spares
kits.&nbsp;  We've got lots of YOUR spare time.&nbsp;  Let's do
it!"<small><a href="#F23"><b>[23]</b></a></small>


<p>

Stage Three also starts a more methodical replacement of components on a scale
not attempted at earlier stages.&nbsp;  Let us say that we have what appears
to be a hard disk problem.&nbsp;  Here is a typical replacement checklist:
(You will be asked to reboot and let users use the system between each change
 to see if the problem is really fixed or see if it will crash again)


<dl compact>
<dt>1.
<dd>

Reformat media and restore entire system from backup tapes.

<dt>2.
<dd>

Switch to different disk media and install system on new media.

<dt>3.
<dd>

Re-align heads on drives, reformat media and restore entire
system.<small><a href="#F24"><b>[24]</b></a></small>

<dt>4.
<dd>

Replace hard disk servo and controller boards.&nbsp;
This usually means reformatting and restoring the
entire system.

<dt>5.
<dd>

Replace cables between drives and host controller.&nbsp;  Oh, and
why not?&nbsp;  Restore entire system from tape just in
case.&nbsp; It only takes several hours.

<dt>6.
<dd>

Replace all cards in tape drives in case they are somehow
affecting disk drives located across the room.&nbsp;  You
might be able to talk them out of reformatting the hard
disks on this one.

<dt>7.
<dd>

Replace host disk channel controller.

<dt>8.
<dd>

Call into question integrity of the backup tapes
used for all previous restores.&nbsp;  Restore entire system
from two-month-old tapes.&nbsp;  Expect some user annoyance
when two months of work and mail disappears and later when
all new work also disappears when you go back to newer tapes.

<dt>9.
<dd>

Swap all memory cards to see if problem might really be
a memory problem in main CPU.

<dt>10.
<dd>

Embark on new wave of diagnostics to determine why
the CPU can't find main memory any more.

<dt>11.
<dd>

Experiment with microcode, EISA configuration and other
firmware revisions to see if any combinations work better
than others, including combinations not recommended by the
software side of the organization.

<dt>12.
<dd>

Replace CPU or if multiple CPUs, replace them one at a time, or swap
them around from one slot to another.

<dt>13.
<dd>

Replace backplane (if possible in the field).&nbsp;  Also consider replacing all
interconnect cabling in CPU cabinet.

<dt>14.
<dd>

If any error messages about nonexistent peripherals are
seen, ask customer to purchase missing peripherals to see
if that helps.&nbsp;  For best results and most reliable
operation, your system might really need to have a punch card
reader.<small><a href="#F25"><b>[25]</b></a></small>

</dl>

<p>

No matter what the problem is, there are just over a dozen steps worth of
work in Stage Three before the Stage Three timer expires.&nbsp;  If the problem
isn't getting any worse, you get about a week at Stage Three.&nbsp;  If the
system is degenerating and less of it works by the hour, Stage Four 
can arrive in as few as four days.


<p>

You really can't accelerate movement to Stage Four on your
own.<small><a href="#F26"><b>[26]</b></a></small>&nbsp;
Reporting the problems and misdeeds of the FSEs for all to see on the
Internet only works once and doesn't get you beyond Stage three no matter
when you use that ploy.

The locations selected by field service organizations for their
"Regional" facilities always seem to be in places where there are no
direct flights between their location and yours, forcing these people
or their part inventories to travel by goat track to reach your site,
arriving some days later.

Your input isn't really desired at this point either.&nbsp;  They pretty
much want to experience the entire thing themselves, even if the
carnage is well-documented.&nbsp;  The chalk outline on the floor of a
FSE from an earlier stage of this problem ticket who dropped a wrench
into the power distribution system isn't good enough evidence; one of
the Stage Three people must try doing the same thing to see if it
really is a bad thing to do.

A reference to an original Star Trek series episode, "Spock's Brain",
considered one of the worst Star Trek episodes ever, even worse than
the ones where William Shatner makes computers commit suicide by
talking to them.&nbsp;  At this point in the support structure, you
will discover that sometimes the FSEs don't even need to talk to your
computer to make it kill itself - just being in the room is deadly
enough.


<a name="F21">

FSEs clearly have portable personal defensive shields, or else they 
all would be dead now from asking questions like this.&nbsp;   There are
far too many heavy things available in the typical computer room that
can be used to commit a mischief.

That's Mr. Peabody from "The "Rocky and Bullwinkle show", who knows
exactly what all the diagnostics are saying, is the only person who
does, and probably wrote the diagnostics as well in some vendor-unique
language, like BLISS.&nbsp;  In addition, on one of his trips to
historic earth in his Way-Back Machine, Mr.  Peabody brought back some
Neandethals, solely because they happened to exactly fit the company
FSE uniforms that had already been bought and the
company didn't want to pay to have them altered.&nbsp;  It appears that
these FSEs deal mainly with disk drive alignments and other delicate
adjustments on your equipment.&nbsp;  "No problem!&nbsp;
Mongo got pipe wrench!"

If you don't have removable hard disk media, this may sound confusing.&nbsp;

You think I am making this one up.&nbsp;  Wrong.&nbsp;  At one site, the FSEs
actually brought in a piece of equipment unlike any we had, and
connected it up to see if that would make a problem go away, or at
least cause the system to quit whining about this optional hardware
not being present.&nbsp;  Of course, it is never any piece of hardware
you would actually want or could use.

Stuffing the Stage Three FSEs under the false floor or into an

<h2>
Stage Four
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your problems go National!
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 or&nbsp; &nbsp; "We've come to sell you the new
model or service package<small><a href="#F27"><b>[27]</b></a></small>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
and to tell you
that we really don't support the configuration you

<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
you angry?  &nbsp; Okay, Okay! &nbsp;  Put down the chair and we'll keep
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
working on your issue."
</h2>

<p>

Okay, so Stage Three didn't work out so well.&nbsp;  Don't worry, it's probably
something obvious, like the planetary alignment of your computer room.


<p>

Stage Four personnel usually come from the corporate headquarters and
review the things that Stage Three replaced, and will probably replace
a few of them again, but in a different order.


<p>

Stage Four specializes in replacing things that appear to have (and usually
have) nothing to do with the problem whatsoever and don't seem to have the
same goal of any of the previous stages.&nbsp;  Changing things for the sake of
change seems to be part of the art of problem resolution in Stage Four.&nbsp;
Science and logical process were killed and swapped-out in Stage Three.&nbsp;
So for your hard disk problem, expect the ribbon on your printers to be
replaced, tape drive heads to be cleaned and calibrated, and to have most of
the false floor ripped up for days.&nbsp;  Part by part, the system will be
replaced.&nbsp;  You need plenty of room for all the replaced parts and cables 
that will start to accumulate around the
area.<small><a href="#F29"><b>[29]</b></a></small>


<p>

Tip: You might want to write down what your systems configuration was when
you started all of this so that you might be able to get back to that
arrangement, or at least so that you can get all your parts back.&nbsp;
Systems have been known to have been "fixed" by disconnecting the offending
hardware or turning off the alarms from the hardware that are trying to warn
you of data corruption because that hardware really is broken.


<p>

Stage Four also has a special squad that deals in "blame
assignment"<small><a href="#F30"><b>[30]</b></a></small>,
looking for anything at all that might be external to the equipment listed
in the service agreement that might be the cause of the problem, at least in
some envisioned parallel dimension where our physical laws of nature do not
apply.&nbsp;  They will look for current leakage from the false floor to the
computer cabinet, ignoring comments that the rubber wheels on the computer
probably take care of insulating the system against any millivolt of
differential they happen to locate across a 100 foot computer room floor.


<p>

Then comes the temperature and humidity monitors,  and the stern
recommendations to change both settings in ways that end up making it rain
in your computer room.&nbsp; Of course once that happens, the Stage Four
blame squad can point out that it may have rained in there previously and
that this might have been the cause of the previous failures.&nbsp;  This
is your opportunity to respond by pointing out that, until now, your computer
room has never been visited by beings from the planet Cretin, so prior
rain-making activity was unlikely.
<small><a href="#F31"><b>[31]</b></a></small>&nbsp; Despite your assurances
of no prior moronic or paranormal activity, they may hang doggedly onto this
discovery even if the rain causes a completely different problem, like
shocking the stuffing out of one of the lower-tier FSEs, still hiding behind
the system.


<p>

Finally, you will see them bring up the Power Disturbance Monitor(TM), and
gradually you will be unplugging things all over the building to prove that
they are not causing the problem.<small><a href="#F32"><b>[32]</b></a></small>&nbsp;
Oh, you can leave the coffee maker 
plugged-in, as that is a priority piece of equipment for the FSEs.


<p>

Another thing that may happen at Stage Four is the recovery of old parts.&nbsp;
You remember all the boards swapped-out by all the previous FSEs?&nbsp;  Stage
Four has been known to conclude that this system only works well with a
particular vintage of cards, and will try to retrieve them and put them
all back in your system, even if some have since made it into machines across
town.&nbsp;  Due to the lack of tagging boards with solid failures, this ends
up being an opportunity for more random cards from the ten or twelve spares
kits lining the room to find their way into your machine.&nbsp;  As you might
guess, the chances of things not getting even worse after doing this is very
small.


<p>

Stage Four will last as long as the service company can possibly stand it.&nbsp;
Only when the FSEs are down to two flat-head screws and the Emergency-Off
switch as the only things that haven't been replaced or fiddled-with, will
you possibly move on to Stage Five on the FSE timetable.&nbsp;  I say possibly,
because they may decide the problem is "hard" and toss the problem back to the
software group for a couple of months at this
juncture.<small><a href="#F33"><b>[33]</b></a></small>


<p>

The threat of legal action, or long-range nuclear weapons directed at high
levels of the company can cause Stage Five to appear before the end of
time, but you might have to start walking towards the court house with 
the lawsuit papers as well as the launch codes in hand before anything happens.

Also known as "Bad Timing".&nbsp;  This is where the sales and marketing
organization
arrive during (and usually oblivious to) your crisis to try to sell
your firm some higher level of support or new hardware.&nbsp;  Now,
someone on your side of the table mentions that we would really like
to see the vendor solve the problems with the hardware we have now
before we buy any new products.&nbsp;  The vendor representatives
always seem ready for a response like this, smoothly replying by
saying something like "Well, I am certain the issue is just lost
in the system or is waiting on more input from your staff, but if you
would like, you can call me next week with the open ticket number
and I'll be happy to look into it."&nbsp;  This is your cue to have
one of your people speak-up and say, "the ticket number is
C970207-3290" quoting from memory and also point out it has been open
over a year.&nbsp; This revelation basically kills the tempo of the
presentation, even before the PowerPoint demo crashes of its own
accord.  Tip:  Wait until after they pay for lunch before torpedoing
the show.


<a name="F28">

<p>
<dt>[28]
<dd>

Related, sometimes the vendor will "address" the problem by claiming
your hardware configuration isn't a valid one, even after you point out
that the unit was shipped from the factory that way, and it is even
a configuration listed in the catalog.&nbsp;  Now the statement may
change to "Well, it isn't supported now, because we found people might
have used it stupidly", even if what you are trying to do isn't the
slightest bit stupid.


<a name="F29">
</a>
<p>
<dt>[29]
<dd>

Any attempts by the FSEs to track what parts are on site is abandoned
by Stage Three, and even the cards that end up in your system when the
problem is fixed won't match any of the serial numbers the FS
organization has on file for your system, which can cause additional
problems the next time you need maintenance.


<p>

At the end of the service visits, any survivors in the Stage Zero
or Stage One personnel will be given the task to cart six carloads
of stuff back to the local depot.&nbsp;  All the other FSEs will escape
back into whatever dimension that they came from rather than 
participate in this task.

<dd>

Shortly after the arrival, you will be able to identify the member
of the secret "Blame Squad", as he/she will wander into other areas
of your computer room, looking to see what brands of equipment you
have from other vendors, devices that can be later blamed as possible
sources of the problems.&nbsp;   You can usually tell the less-experienced
"blame assigners", who will eventually say stuff like, "This is
probably all caused by that General Electric XG47131480D you have over
there."&nbsp;  After looking for this device you have never heard of,
you respond with, "Uh, that's the computer room power
transformer."&nbsp; Experienced "blame assigners" usually are better
at picking their blame targets.

Always be concerned when your computer repairman starts altering
settings on the air handlers for the computer room.&nbsp;  Use duct
tape to stop this activity.&nbsp;  What you use the duct tape on (air
handler or FSE) is left to your discretion.

<p>
<dt>[32]
<dd>

In a datacenter with two mainframes, the FSEs seriously wanted us
to shut down the other system to see if their system was affected
in any way by the presence of the other computer.&nbsp;   Since they
refused to let go of this theory and would not try anything else until
this was checked, we did as they asked, annoying thousands of
students.&nbsp;  As fate would have it, the failing machine now failed
even faster, but then, they were changing several things at once.


<a name="F33">
</a>
<p>
<dt>[33]
<dd>

In the case I am thinking of, ticket A has been open for a while and
the vendor finally comes up with a fix, but the fix requires the
customer to upgrade to operating system release B, and then apply
corrections to that in the form of a patch kit C.&nbsp;  To that B+C
system can fix D be added.&nbsp;  The customer installs OS B and
immediately starts getting machine checks.&nbsp;  On the chance that
the patch kit also solves the problem, patch kit C is also applied
since that was planned anyway.&nbsp;  The crashes continue.&nbsp;  The
release notes for OS upgrade B report that it fixes a problem exactly
like the one the system started having, and the notes go on to say
that despite the evidence, this isn't a software problem (uh, yeah),
and that the failure only happens if you have the hardware revision
E which has some sort of flaw.&nbsp;  Our system had a newer hardware
revision F, which supposedly did not have the hardware problem.


<p>

Based on that information, what do you as the computer vendor do?&nbsp;
Why, you recall Patch Kit C and have the customer remove it, replace
the customers revision F hardware with revision F (yes, same version)
hardware, and guess what?&nbsp;  The system still crashes.&nbsp;  Now
the vendor starts talking about replacing memory cards, CPU cards and
the system backplane and other random hardware, and eventually replaces
all of these things (some repeatedly) with no improvement.&nbsp;  
Eventually, they replaced the backplane and entire metal frame,
thinking that they had swapped swapped everything else.  This didn't
fix the problem.  
	


<p>

Now, you might think that maybe, just maybe, the problem might
have something to do with the software that was changed at the point
when the system started crashing (installing upgrade B), but no, that
was one of the the last things tried.&nbsp;  Meanwhile, the original
goal of trying to apply the fix to problem A was on hold for months.
(A FDDI network card completely unrelated to what the error
messages were reporting was eventually found to be the true culprit.)
This is an unusual case, since the hardware people are usually keen
to lob this type of problem back over the net into the OS groups
hands.

<h2>
Stage Five
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They let the guru out of the box!
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or &nbsp; &nbsp; "You can have what's behind the curtain!"
</h2>

<p>

Stage Five.&nbsp;  Wow.&nbsp;  It almost never happens.&nbsp;  Until recently,
I thought it wasn't possible at DEC now that Ken has retired (who has the
key to the box?).&nbsp;  Being at Stage Five, you have arrived at the pinnacle
of Field Support.&nbsp;   There are only two choices left to the equipment
maker:  One, to roll in a complete replacement system and let the existing
system be "accidentally" exported to a forbidden country, or Two, let one of
the gurus out of the box,  who might be able to identify the real problem and
get it fixed.<small><a href="#F34"><b>[34]</b></a></small>


<p>

Neither choice is popular with the vendor.&nbsp;  The first costs a lot of
money, and sometimes those pesky border patrol or customs people catch the
faulty system being exported to North Korea or wherever.&nbsp;  The second
option might allow
the guru to be exposed to real-life, something that could be far worse.&nbsp;
He might find out that Nixon resigned, that nobody makes slide rules any more,
or that IBM finally built a computer with a stack
pointer.<small><a href="#F35"><b>[35]</b></a></small>&nbsp; Plus, the
guru might still recommend replacing the system and the vendor will still
have to try to smuggle your broken system out of the country in order to
dispose of it.


<p>

In one of the cases where I witnessed a Stage Five escalation, the system
had been putting out a BUGHLT: SWPUPT message for six weeks and crashing each
time.&nbsp;  The message claims that the hard disk driver or paging code (or
both), which should never be swapped to disk, had been swapped.&nbsp;  This is
bad.&nbsp; However, at least there was code in the operating system that said
"I did a bad thing" when it
happened.<small><a href="#F36"><b>[36]</b></a></small>


<p>

In response to this crash that was increasing in frequency daily, the FSEs
had gradually replaced nearly every component of the mainframe, all the
cables to the hard disk drives, most internal cabling, all boards in the
drives, realigned the heads on the drives several times, reformatted the
packs and had us reinstall the operating system more than a dozen times.&nbsp;
They examined the raised flooring for electrical current loops, looked for
uneven cooling, and at various times blamed the failures on the telephone
lines the modems were connected to, the console DECwriter, the printers and
tape drives, even the proximity of an IBM 370-155 (hmm, maybe...), but one by
one these were eliminated, except for the IBM.&nbsp;  I think we erected a
curtain or something as a joke so the DEC-20 could not "see" the IBM.&nbsp;
It didn't help.


<p>

After six weeks, there were only a few sheets of metal casing and the
wheels that hadn't been replaced on the entire system and the problem
persisted.&nbsp;  We had also gone through periods of having a completely
useless system as working parts were replaced with broken parts in such large
quantities that no one could recall what had been changed last.


<p>

So, just when they were about to break down and replace the entire
system, they decided to let a guru out of the box in Maynard.


<p>

For the arrival, nearly all of the non-Stage 4 FSEs were asked to

The guru walks in and looks at the OS logs of the
crashes, which had about as much debug information as your typical MS-DOS
"Null-pointer assignment" error message.&nbsp;  He completely ignores the reams
of output from the diagnostics run over the previous six weeks.&nbsp;  After
ten minutes or so, he proclaims that there is some dirt in a glide track in
the head assembly of a particular hard disk drive.&nbsp;  Then he leaves for
the airport and goes back to Maynard.&nbsp;    Maybe he asked the taxi to wait.


<p>

The entire FSE garrison echos "WHAT?"  This was impossible.&nbsp;  Sure, they
hadn't taken this particular assembly apart (it wasn't easy), but why would
it cause that error message instead of a disk read or write error
message?<small><a href="#F38"><b>[38]</b></a></small>&nbsp;
And how could a U-shaped piece of metal cause all this?   And why didn't
the diagnostics ever fail or report a problem in this
area?<small><a href="#F39"><b>[39]</b></a></small>


<p>

They were almost ready to ignore this advice and roll the replacement
system in when someone decided to spend the hour cleaning this track.&nbsp;
It worked.&nbsp;  The system, now with several hundred stripped bolts and
worn connectors, ran fine, even when we started four copies of HAUNT
at the same time, the ultimate system stress
test.<small><a href="#F40"><b>[40]</b></a></small>


<p>

So we didn't get a new computer, but the problem was solved, and a
considerable percentage of the computer science college got a grade
of Incomplete for the semester.&nbsp;  The system behaved itself just fine
until it rained in the computer room (real rain, not the sprinkler or air
conditioning system), but that's another story.


<p>

So there you have it, the Six Stages of Field Service Support.

<h2>
Notes on Stage Five
</h2>

<p>
<dl compact>
<dt>[34]
<dd>

The above description has dealt with issues of a hardware nature
and their escalation.&nbsp;  I have also seen a case of reaching Stage
Five on the software side of a computer company.&nbsp;  In this case,
after complaining about the same software problem for 18 months,
the computer company sent a letter saying that they didn't have any
plans to fix the problem in question, or even research it seriously,
despite prior claims of doing work to resolve the problem over the
previous year and a half.&nbsp;  Previous requests for the source code
for the affected modules so that we could fix it ourselves were always
ignored without comment.


<p>

My company immediately responded to the letter by announcing to this
vendor that we would never buy anything from them ever again and
would dispose of all our existing equipment at the first opportunity,
possibly utilizing our 30th floor perch in some spectacle that would
be televised:  "Tonight on Jerry Springer!  When computers go bad!"
or "The Late Show Computer Toss!"


<p>

The computer vendor (who had previously been saying that they were 
working on the problem on and off for the previous 18 months), had
come up with a patch a year earlier that wouldn't even boot, but mostly
used a series of conference calls to keep us informed on the 
lack of progress), now suddenly decides that we might be serious about
having this problem fixed and to listening to why we would not
abandon the software configuration we preferred for one that they
supported "better".&nbsp;  (I point out here that most positive values
are greater than zero.)&nbsp;  We finally forced this issue by asking
fellow users of this type of system on the Internet for their opinion of the
two filesystem methods in question, the one with the bug and the
vendors favorite.&nbsp;  With one exception, everybody who responded
was using the filesystem with the bug that the computer vendor
was effectively abandoning.&nbsp;  Some sites had tried the vendors
sweetheart system for a few days and then switched-back,
bugs and all.

<p>

Well, apparently the computer vendor saw this discussion on the
Internet and ran some of their own tests and found out that their
customers might actually have a point about the performance difference
of the two systems and that their little darling was in-fact a
performance pig.&nbsp;  Suddenly, the orphaned filesystem software was
being looked-at and bugs and stupid inefficiencies were being found
all over the place in the operating system, at least according to the
now-resumed weekly conference calls.

<p>

At one point, to show positive activity, the vendor let a software
guru out of the box to visit us, along with someone who can be best
described as part diplomat and part damage-control officer.&nbsp;  Of
course, to make sure we wouldn't actually solve the problem while they
were at the customers site or honor our previous requests for source
code to let us fix it ourselves, they brought paper listings of the
source code in question, which we never got to see.

<p>

Of course, having been in a similar position in a former job, the
reality is that the software guru can do little apart from observe
during the visit, since doing code development/correction while
surrounded by a bunch of pacing and chattering people is tough, and
you probably don't have any of your normal development tools (plus
nothing but a paper listing, but that was self-inflicted).&nbsp;
Therefore, the secret goal is to make sure that you know how to make
the failure occur predictably and get back to the lab where you can
actually work on the problem and not have to work in some corridor
that the customer sticks you in that the customer calls "a work
space".

<p>

As you might expect, letting the software guru out of the box in a
software-related Stage Five doesn't mean the problem gets fixed
right away, or even near-term.&nbsp;  That is only the first phase of
the Software Stage Five, which can drag on for months.&nbsp;  In my case,
after the open problem report passed its 55th month mark and 26 months
since the most recent "get serious about fixing it" event, we just stopped
using that computer and moved to an operating system and hardware that
didn't have that issue.

I ran into similar people when I visited AT&amp;T's Murray Hill facility
in 1991, but the person I talked to there thought Andropov would release
his grip on the Soviet people in a few years.&nbsp;  Of course, Andropov
had died several years earlier and the Soviet Union barely existed in 
1991.

This opens an even more interesting question.&nbsp;  Why do you put a
message in the system that reports the equivalent of:

<blockquote>
<tt>
"Hi there!!  I just did something stupid and committed suicide!&nbsp;
I will crash in a few moments and lose everybody's work.&nbsp;
In the meantime, here is some music to listen to!" BEEP BEEP BEEP ...
</tt>
(DEC-20s would send out nine BEEPs in a pattern that sounded almost
exactly like the morse code S-0-S.)

</blockquote>

Also, why do you document this type of event which will cause your
customers to ask these types of pointed questions?

Please refer to the "Monty Python" "New Gas Cooker Sketch", where a
seemingly endless supply of gas company employees show up to
connect-up a single gas stove but are all unable to do so because of
various regulations or lack of paperwork.&nbsp;  This is the scene in
the computer room all through Stage Five, and reducing the number of
people in the room is a good plan, but at the same time it would be
nice if these people could learn something from the guru instead of
waiting in the hall.

You know you are getting close to the truth of the situation when
the FSEs themselves start asking the types of questions you normally
ask to embarrass them, stuff like "won't it work better plugged-in?"
or "You do know that the shelf is installed upside-down in this unit,
right?  Turning the cards over might make them go in without pushing
so hard."

Important Axiom:

<blockquote>

Diagnostics only find known problems.

At the first hint of a solved problem in Stage Five, the doors on all
the equipment cabinets will slam shut, so no one has any idea what
cards are where in the system, but that doesn't matter.&nbsp;   If any
major peripherals don't work now, you can always open new tickets
and start at Stage Zero.&nbsp;  The goal for the FSEs now is to
back-away slowly and not make any sudden moves that might cause
the system to crash again.&nbsp; Even if the system is functioning by
a thread, it probably won't break until the next time someone bumps
into the cabinet or when the local FSE comes out for the next
preventative maintenance.   
<p>
As always, the FSE prime-directive is that:

<blockquote>

If you can't fix it right away, make sure whatever it rapidly becomes
Someone Else's Problem (SEP).

</blockquote>


Note that Douglas Adams, the late science fiction writer, based
an entire novel on the subject of what he called "SEP fields". &nbsp; He 
suggested that such fields could be used to "cloak" star-ships, planets and
other objects from prying eyes, simply by making the object completely
uninteresting and unimportant to any viewer, and thus essentially
invisible.&nbsp;  Such a scheme would accomplish "practical" invisibility at a
fraction of the cost of all those systems that try to bend light and
such.&nbsp;  What Mr. Adams failed to discover in his research is that for
years before he came along, FSEs have been employing small SEP fields to
distract computer system owners from the real problems, both to save their
respective firms money, and to make sure the problems that can't be concealed
escalate rapidly into someone else's jurisdiction, effectively making the
problem invisible, at least to the original FSE.
